# WAV to Transcript

This script is used to transcribe an audio file. It splits the audio file into segments, transcribes each segment using Google's Speech Recognition service, and writes the transcriptions to a text file.

# Installation

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This includes the command to install the dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file.

## Usage

Run the script with the path to the audio file as an argument:

```bash
python convert-to-transcript.py path/to/audio/file
```
